# Research & Analysis

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Backend Framework
- **Spring Boot**: Latest version (3.x)
  - Provides robust REST API support
  - Built-in security features for API key authentication
  - Strong integration with JPA/Hibernate
  - Production-ready metrics and health checks
  - Supports both embedded and external databases

### Database
- **Development Environment**:
  - H2 in-memory database
  - Enables quick local development and testing
  - Compatible with JPA/Hibernate

- **Production Environment**:
  - AWS RDS PostgreSQL
  - Robust, scalable, and production-ready
  - Strong ACID compliance
  - Good performance for our transaction volume requirements

### Infrastructure (AWS)
- **Compute**: Amazon ECS
  - Container orchestration for Spring Boot application
  - Scalability and reliability
  - Easy integration with other AWS services

- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  - SSL/TLS termination
  - Public endpoint for API access
  - Health check monitoring

- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch
  - Application and infrastructure metrics
  - Log aggregation
  - Alarms and dashboards

- **Security**:
  - IAM roles and policies
  - Security Groups for network isolation
  - API key authentication

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**
  - AWS provider for resource management
  - State management for infrastructure
  - Module organization for reusability

## Performance Considerations

### Transaction Processing
- Required throughput: 25 TPS
- Maximum latency: 5 seconds
- Considerations:
  - Database connection pooling
  - Caching strategies for fraud patterns
  - Async logging for audit records

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling through ECS
- RDS read replicas if needed
- Connection pooling configuration
- Load balancer distribution

## Security Analysis

### API Security
- API key authentication
- HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Rate limiting considerations
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest (RDS)
- Encryption in transit (TLS)
- IAM roles and permissions
- Network security through Security Groups

### Audit Trail
- Transaction logging
- Decision logging
- Error logging
- Performance metrics

## Integration Points

### External Services
- Experian integration for customer verification
- Metrics reporting to CloudWatch
- Log aggregation in CloudWatch

### Client Integration
- REST API documentation
- API key management
- Error handling patterns
- Status code definitions

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. Database performance under load
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, monitoring, connection pooling
2. Integration service availability (Experian)
   - Mitigation: Timeouts, circuit breakers, fallback logic
3. API key management
   - Mitigation: Secure distribution, rotation policy

### Operational Risks
1. Deployment impact
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment strategy
2. Data consistency
   - Mitigation: Transaction isolation levels, proper error handling
3. Resource scaling
   - Mitigation: Auto-scaling policies, monitoring alerts

## Open Questions
1. Experian integration details - need API documentation
2. API key rotation policy requirements
3. Logging retention requirements
4. Backup and disaster recovery requirements
5. SSL/TLS certificate management strategy
