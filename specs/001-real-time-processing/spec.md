# Feature Specification: Real-time Transaction Fraud Detection

**Feature Branch**: `001-real-time-processing`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Real-time processing of transactions to detect fraud"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As GlobalFraud, we want to provide a centralized platform that automatically analyzes transactions in real-time as they occur, so that our client companies can detect and prevent fraudulent activities before they cause financial losses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new transaction is initiated, **When** the transaction matches known fraud patterns, **Then** the system should analyze it against fraud rules
2. **Given** a flagged transaction, **When** the risk level is high, **Then** the system should return a high-risk status to the integrating system
3. **Given** a legitimate transaction, **When** it is processed by the fraud detection system, **Then** the system should return a low-risk status to the integrating system

### Edge Cases
- Service availability: Integrating systems are responsible for handling scenarios when the fraud detection service is temporarily unavailable
- Currency support: System only processes transactions in USD currency
- False positives: Integrating systems are responsible for handling customer communications and responses when transactions are flagged as high risk
- How does the system handle high-volume transaction periods?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process transactions in real-time as they are received
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze each transaction against predefined fraud patterns
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain a risk score for each account based on the following rules:
  - Match with known fraudulent credit cards: +1000 points
  - Invalid area code/zip code/city/state cross-reference: +25 points
  - PO Box address: +10 points
  - Experian match results:
    - Exact match: +0 points
    - Partial match: +25 points
    - No match: +100 points
  All scoring rules and their associated point values MUST be configurable
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide configurable rules for fraud detection
- **FR-005**: System MUST return clear status codes and risk levels for all analyzed transactions
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all fraud detection decisions for audit purposes
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle transaction volumes of at least 25 transactions per second
- **FR-008**: System MUST complete fraud analysis within 5 seconds of receiving a transaction
- **FR-009**: System MUST support manual review of flagged transactions
- **FR-010**: System MUST track false positive rates for continuous improvement
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow individual fraud detection rules to be enabled or disabled independently
- **FR-012**: System MUST only process transactions in USD currency

### Key Entities
- **Transaction**: The financial transaction being analyzed, including amount, timestamp, merchant, location, and device information
- **Account**: The user account associated with the transaction, including history and risk profile
- **FraudPattern**: Defined patterns that indicate potential fraudulent activity
- **Alert**: Notification generated when suspicious activity is detected
- **AuditLog**: Record of all fraud detection decisions and actions taken
