# Implementation Plan: Integration Testing with Postman

**Branch**: `002-add-integration-testing` | **Date**: October 5, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-add-integration-testing/spec.md`

## Summary
Implementation of comprehensive integration testing using Postman for the fraud detection API endpoints. This includes creating test collections with data-driven tests, environment configurations for all deployment stages, and both manual and automated execution capabilities through Postman UI and Newman CLI.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.2.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Postman, Newman CLI, JSON Schema  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (for test data)  
**Testing**: Postman Tests, Newman CLI  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Postman + Newman)  
**Project Type**: API Testing  
**Performance Goals**: Test execution < 5 minutes for full suite  
**Constraints**: API key authentication, all environments support  
**Scale/Scope**: Full API coverage with data-driven tests

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. Integration Testing Requirements ✓
   - Comprehensive API testing coverage
   - Data-driven test scenarios
   - Environment-specific configurations

2. Test-First Development ✓
   - Test collection structure defined before implementation
   - Environment configurations established upfront
   - Test data prepared before execution

3. Observability ✓
   - Detailed test execution reports
   - Clear test failure messages
   - Environment-specific logging

4. Documentation ✓
   - Test collection documentation
   - Environment setup guide
   - Test data schema documentation

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial Constitution Check
- [x] Phase 0: Research
- [x] Phase 1: Design
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check
- [x] Phase 2: Ready for Tasks

## Complexity Tracking
No significant complexity concerns identified. The implementation follows standard integration testing practices using well-established tools (Postman and Newman).

## Next Steps
1. Execute Phase 0 (Research):
   - Investigate Postman collection structure best practices
   - Review Newman CLI integration options
   - Document test data requirements

2. Execute Phase 1 (Design):
   - Define test collection structure
   - Create environment configuration templates
   - Document test data model
   - Establish contract definitions

3. Prepare for Phase 2 (Tasks):
   - Break down implementation into specific tasks
   - Define task dependencies and order
   - Set up CI/CD integration requirements
