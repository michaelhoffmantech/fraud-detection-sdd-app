# Feature Specification: Integration Testing Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-integration-testing`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add integration testing using Postman to ensure API reliability and functionality"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What authentication mechanism should the API endpoints use for integration testing? ‚Üí A: API key authentication
- Q: Which environments should the Postman tests support through environment configurations? ‚Üí A: All environments (local, dev, staging, prod)
- Q: How should the Postman tests be executable? ‚Üí A: Both manual UI and CLI execution
- Q: What level of test coverage should be implemented in the Postman collection? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive with data-driven tests
- Q: How should the Postman tests be incorporated into the development workflow? ‚Üí A: Both manual and CI/CD integration

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a QA engineer or developer, I want to execute comprehensive integration tests using Postman against the fraud detection API endpoints to ensure they work correctly and reliably in an integrated environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a running instance of the fraud detection service, **When** running the Postman test suite, **Then** all API endpoints should be validated for correct functionality
2. **Given** a test collection in Postman, **When** executing tests against the fraud detection endpoints, **Then** response payloads, status codes, and headers should match specifications
3. **Given** a series of fraud detection scenarios, **When** running integration tests, **Then** the system should demonstrate correct behavior for both valid and invalid cases

### Edge Cases
- What happens when API endpoints are unavailable?
- How does system handle malformed request payloads?
- What occurs when dependent services (if any) are down?
- How are rate limiting and throttling scenarios tested?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST have a comprehensive Postman collection covering all fraud detection API endpoints
- **FR-002**: Integration tests MUST use API key authentication for all endpoints
- **FR-003**: Integration tests MUST validate response status codes, headers, and payload structures
- **FR-003**: Tests MUST cover both successful and error scenarios for each endpoint
- **FR-004**: Test suite MUST include environment configurations for all deployment stages (local, development, staging, production)
- **FR-005**: Tests MUST validate the end-to-end flow of fraud detection scenarios
- **FR-006**: System MUST include comprehensive test data sets for data-driven testing, representing various fraud patterns and legitimate transactions
- **FR-007**: Test execution MUST be possible through both Postman UI and Newman CLI
- **FR-008**: Test execution MUST produce detailed reports of test results and coverage
- **FR-009**: Integration tests MUST be executable both manually and through CI/CD pipelines

### Key Entities
- **Test Collection**: Organized set of API requests and associated tests
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific variables and settings for test execution
- **Test Data**: Sample datasets for various fraud detection scenarios
- **Test Reports**: Documentation of test execution results and coverage metrics
